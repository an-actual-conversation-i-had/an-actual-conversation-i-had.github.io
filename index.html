                “Cycling is about sex more than anything. Anytime anything is between your legs and your heart rate is above two hundred its basically sex. You might as well be having sex. When was the last time you had sex? I had sex this morning pedaling down here. I was listening to 1980s Chicago house and I was panting and groaning and sweating and my tiny little heart was racing and I was so excited. When you’re sweating, legs trembling, moaning -- ugh ugh ugh ragh gah ugh ugh -- like that, is that not sex? Oh, c’mon. We’re wearing skintight outfits, some of us are half naked and showing our nipples- It’s sex. There are naked bike rides too. Legal. I had an orgasm coming down here to meet you. Figuratively, metaphorically, I had an orgasm. No, what the heck? I’m not sexually attracted to my bike. You know, some people ride with butt plugs? Not me, but I know a guy. It is a beautiful thing and I’m getting really horny right now just thinking about riding, but I’m not like a- uh a- a cyclophile- Yeah, I think that’s a word. A velophile- I’m just a nymph. A little cycling nymphomaniac. A cyclomaniac. Velonymph. Don’t look at me like that. I don’t need to defend myself. I’m just a horny person, and I happen to be a cyclist. It’s not my fault. It’s how God made me. Cycling is about sex and freedom. That last time we did a double century together I cried. And I always cry during sex.”
